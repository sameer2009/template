        The bomber, piloted by the commander of the 509th Composite Group, Colonel Paul Tibbets, flew at low
        altitude on automatic pilot before climbing to 31,000 feet as it neared the target area. At
        approximately 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time the Enola Gay released "Little Boy," its 9,700-pound uranium
        gun-type bomb, over the city. Tibbets immediately dove away to avoid the anticipated shock wave.
        Forty-three seconds later, a huge explosion lit the morning sky as Little Boy detonated 1,900 feet above
        the city, directly over a parade field where soldiers of the Japanese Second Army were doing
        calisthenics. Though already eleven and a half miles away, the Enola Gay was rocked by the blast. At
        first, Tibbets thought he was taking flak. After a second shock wave (reflected from the ground) hit the
        plane, the crew looked back at Hiroshima. "The city was hidden by that awful cloud . . . boiling up,
        mushrooming, terrible and incredibly tall," Tibbets recalled. The yield of the explosion was later
        estimated at 15 kilotons (the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT).
